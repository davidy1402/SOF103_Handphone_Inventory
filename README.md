## Overview
This is a C++ inventory management system for a handphone store, developed for the SOF103 assignment. The system manages 50 phone models and includes features like product management and low stock alerts.

## Repository Structure
- `main.cpp`: Main program file with core functions.
- `inventory.txt`: Data file containing 50 phone models (e.g., ID, name, price, quantity, reorder level).
- `.gitignore`: Ignores compiled files (e.g., `.exe`, `.o`).
